# SPH-Surface-Reconstruction

# Back End Compilation
1. Install all required software following the owner's instructions:
- CompactNSearch: https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/CompactNSearch
- Partio: https://github.com/wdas/partio
- happly: https://github.com/nmwsharp/happly
- OpenMesh: https://graphics.rwth-aachen.de:9000/OpenMesh/OpenMesh
2. Clone the GitHub repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CedricM9/SPH-Surface-Reconstruction.git
```
3. Change to the BackEndCompilation folder: 
```bash
cd BackEndCompilation
```
4. Set all necessary environment variables for the third-party software:
```bash
export CNSEARCH_DIR = <main directory of the CompactNSearch installation>
export PARTIO_DIR = <main directory of the partio installation>
export HAPPLY_DIR = <directory containing happly.h>
export OMESH_DIR = <main directory of the OpenMesh installation>
```
5. Build the example main file using make:
```bash
make
```
If the linker returns the message "cannot find -lCompactNSearch" try adding the file CompactNSearch.cpp from the src folder of the CompactNSearch repository to the Makefile to be compiled along with main.cpp instead of linking to -l$(CNSEARCH_LIB).<br/>
6. Take care that all dynamic library paths are set:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<main directory of the partio installation>/lib/:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<main directory of the OpenMesh installation>/lib/:
```
7. Execute the example: 
```bash
./main.exe
```
8. Make changes in the main.cpp for your concerns.
  
# Documentation using doxygen
1. Clone the GitHub repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CedricM9/SPH-Surface-Reconstruction.git
```
2. Change to the source code folder: 
```bash
cd LabProject/SurfaceReconstruction
```
3. Generate the documentation: 
```bash
make doc
```
4. Open the documentation: 
```bash
open doc/html/index.html
```

# Batch Job Submission
1. Set all parameters in the GUI that should be used for the batch job.
2. Click on Generate batch script in the GUI.
3. Enter the run-time in minutes and the requested memory in MB according to the prompts.
4. Clone the Github repository on the RWTH Compute Cluster: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CedricM9/SPH-Surface-Reconstruction.git
```
5. Change to the BatchJob directory: 
```bash
cd BatchJob
```
6. Build the executable using make:
```bash
make
```
7. Copy the batch job script generated by the GUI and the executable surfaceReconstruction.exe to the same folder and change to this folder.
7. Check in the batch job script if input and output folder are correct for the compute cluster and adjust them if necessary.
8. Submit the job:
```bash
sbatch < <batch script filename>
```
